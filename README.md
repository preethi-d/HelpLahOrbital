Motivation:

When a student has a burning question about a module, or needs further explanation on a concept, they might find it strange or too slow to post on the IVLE forum. By offering a space to post their question only to fellow students and not to the professors, the stress of asking questions is reduced. Asking to fellow students is also better as they are more relatable and hence may be able to explain the answer in a way that is more understandable. Furthermore, this allows senior students revise concepts by answering and explaining old concepts. IVLE only allows discussion between other students taking the module at the same time as you, but sometimes the best answers may lie with the seniors or other students who already have knowledge on the matter.

Aim:

We hope to make asking questions a less stressful and more enjoyable activity, through gamification and easy communication.

User Stories:

“As a student who has trouble understanding basic concepts and simple questions, I want to be able to post questions on a platform that is less formal and more friendly, so that I can ask questions without feeling nervous or embarrassed.”

“As a student who wants to revise my old concepts and have conversations on the topics that I have knowledge on, I want to be able to help struggling students/juniors in any module with their doubts in an easy and friendly manner.”

“As a student who is revising, I want to be able to view previously answered questions with ease, which may provide me with an answer to my own questions and refresh my concepts.”

“As a student who is shy and nervous to ask questions, I want to be able to post my questions anonymously.” Scope:

A space just for questions and answers from all faculties and courses in NUS. Sorted by faculty, course and modules, this application makes it extremely easy for students to have access to all previously asked questions. It also promotes intellectual discussions in various fields.

Gamification will award points to answers that were “liked” by others, and different amount of points gathered will result in a bronze, silver and gold badge etc. This promotes healthy competition and makes the whole process of learning more fun.
